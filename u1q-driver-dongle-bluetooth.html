                            <p> Hi there, very very new to linux. been using ubuntu for couple of days. so far working like a charm except. like title says wifi slows to crawl when I use bluetooth headset. its cheap Asus Laptop everything works right out of box on ubuntu. H/W path Device Class Description ==================================================== system E402NA /0 bus E402NA. Hi all, I use an Insignia brand bluetooth dongle (https://www.insigniaproducts.com/pdp/NS-PCY5BMA/5655065) for all my bluetooth-related needs, mostly to connect my xbox one controller and my cellphone. This works fine most of the time, but if I ever unplug the dongle and plug it back in, or something else goes wrong, the drivers fail to start. I get Code 10, This device cannot start (https://i.gyazo.com/a464b8b95ed8accc9b673092e1972374.png). I thought it might be an issue with my current. Hi! I have a hp power pavilion (the one from last year that was like 0) and the Bluetooth quit working on it (I damaged it) so I bought a USB adapter for Bluetooth from Kensington as it was the cheapest one near me. It says code 10, I uninstalled the driver, restarted and it restarted saying the same thing. I searched for driver updates and switched it in the “browse computer for update files”. Kensington does not have drivers on their website (or at least where the manual directs So i have a Xiaomi mi mix 3 on MIUI 10.2.2 ANDROID 9 and apparently it does not support connection via OTG for my ds4 controller It works via Bluetooth but after 20 seconds or so it starts lagging (common problem, couldn't fix it using Bluetooth auto connect even) Do other specific "android gamepads" have this problem as well? Can they work using. Title. I got a pair of Anker Soundcore Liberty Lite earbuds recently and I've noticed that when I use them on Windows devices, I get a huge delay with the audio (gt300ms). These earbuds work perfectly fine on my Android phone, and I regularly use a larger pair of Bluetooth headphones on my Windows 10 desktop, which have almost no delay at all. I've tried disabling the Realtek HD audio driver and installing the generic Microsoft driver with no luck. These earbuds are Bluetooth 5.0 and both my Windo. Hello everyone and thanks for coming, any help with this would be highly apreciated. I've been looking for this driver for almost a month now. My adapter was working just fine untill W10 decided to "update" the driver to a generic one (I think it was mostly because of HP droping official suport for it). But now it won't work anymore for my Dualshock4 wich was also working perfectly fine. My only hope would be if someone managed to save an old zip for it. I even tried waybackmachine 
My motherboard doesn't have BlueTooth so I'm using a CSR BlueTooth Dongle ( Amazon Page (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0775YF36R/ref=psdc_3015437011_t1_B01IM8YKPW)). It's 4.0 and supports High-Speed and High powered devices. When I turn BlueTooth radio on it finds the devices labelled as "Motion Controller: Left" and "Motion Controller: Right" but when I try to pair them it just tells me the pairing failed. Any work arounds to get the bluetooth working. This seems to be an issue based on my own experience and past threads in this sub. Just wondering if anyone has been able to find good hardware with appropriate drivers to resolve this issue recently for Windows 7. It's super easy on Windows 10 (my laptop) but I cannot resolve this issue on my PC (Windows. Hi, amp#x200B; finally got my Bluetooth 4.0 dongle and i´m trying to pair the controllers, it doesn´t work. I have 2 different ones now (one went missing so i had to order another now i got both, yay.but nvm). I plug them in (one at a time of course), tried USB 2.0 USB 3.0 even a USB 2.0 adapter in the USB 3.0 because i read somewhere that could help, hold the pairing button for 2 seconds until the controllers start blinking, it just doesn´t work. It shows that the Bluetooth is active. X201 Laptop I5 M560 2.67GHz 8 GB Windows Pro 64 After a disk failure, did clean install of Windows 10 Pro to new SSD, Bluetooth is now not shown in: Taskbar Device Manager (including hidden) Settings - no bluetooth switch Is Enabled in Bios. Is on Automatic in Windows Services. I'm trying to connect my ps3 controller to my computer, but this program that connects the control with the Bluetooth dongle, he reprograms it to only accept Playstation controllers permanently, making me lose my connection with my headphone. This wouldn't be a problem if I could re-do the process to use my headphone again, but I'm afraid this is a one way road, understand me? English ain't my mother language, sorry. Thanks anyway. My microsoft persition mouse likes to cut out and become choppy on bluetooth, happens with both my computers. And my microsoft surface keybord will stop taking input and freeze all input on my computer but the computer will still run normally (keep playing a video and keeping time) I tryed to update drivers to no effect. Anyone have any suggestions. Been trying to connect my bluetooth headphones to ubuntu 16.04 for months to no avail. I'm no linux expert but never has a problem beaten me like this, so much that I stop even trying. Saw today on an ubuntu forum someone mentioning they don't have a bluetooth adapter and I think that may be the reason, my pc simply is not bluetooth compatible. It's a late 2013 model, after. As of the 21/3/18 steam link update, the switch pro controller now appears to work with steam link properly. I knew before you could connect it but the left stick wouldn't have full motion, it appears that is now fixed since this update. I tested it last night and didn't run into any problems. Rumble doesn't work though. Edit: I've added the full steam link update. As you can see they have added lots of new controller support options. 
I was getting tired of getting random disconnects because of the lousy USB port on the DS4, so I finally got myself a Bluetooth dongle and set it up. With native support for the DS4, I have never had a problem using it wired with Rocket League. However, it doesn't seem like this native support works when on Bluetooth. Enabling "Playstation Configuration Support" in Steam makes the game see the controller as an xbox controller and disabling it makes the game not recognize any input at all. While. Its back at it again (https://youtu.be/qtL9lkQp9jA) Yeah it got worse for some reason. Nothing changed about the room and things around but the jitter sure got worse. (Video is choppy for some reason but you can still see the jitter pretty clearly this time) Right hand looks stable left hand is horrid. Problem with : ASUS USB BT400 driver. System: Windows 10 64bit, i7-4790 I have an ASUS USB BT400 dongle that has been working fine for the past 2 months or so. Yesterday I booted up the work pc and my headphones won't connect. Infact there's no connect button. I checked in device manager and it said that there is no driver for the Bluetooth device, so I tried to download the official one, installed it and still nothing. I then went to uninstall the device and every time I've tried it hangs. Hi everyone, I've seen people mention this before, but I wasn't able to see if anyone came up with a solution/reason - I'm having severe input lag with both my 8bitdo controllers (SF30PRO and SF30) over bluetooth, rendering most games unplayable. Has anyone found out why this might be happening or a possible fix? I'm using onboard bluetooth if that matters. I have it working wired via usb no problem but it'd be great if I could use it wirelessly via bluetooth. Running Windows 10. EDIT: If there isn't a way to do this with SCP drivers, is there another way I an utilise my built in bluetooth. The bluetooth on my windows partition doesn't work. I'm hoping someone here knows something I don't, because I have spent hours upon hours googling, trying stuff out, and nothing is solving this. I have a late 2016 15 inch Macbook Pro. I run Windows 10 pro on boot camp. As far as I can tell, the laptops bluetooth is incompatible with windows. 9/10 times i try to pair anything, nothing appears on the list of available devices. 1/10, the device I am trying to pair will appear, but when I click.
